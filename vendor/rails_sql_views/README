== Rails SQL Views

Library which adds SQL Views to Rails. Adds create_view and drop_view to the ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::AbstractAdapter (which makes them available to migrations) and adds support for dumping views in the ActiveRecord::SchemaDumper.

== Installation

To install:

  gem install rails_sql_views
 
Then add the following to your Rails config/environment.rb:

  require_gem 'rails_sql_views'
  require 'rails_sql_views'

== Usage

You can then use create_view and drop_view in your migrations. For example:

  class CreatePersonView < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def self.up
      create_view :v_people, "select * from people" do |t|
        t.column :id
        t.column :name
        t.column :social_security
      end
    end

    def self.down
      drop_view :v_people
    end
  end
  
This extension also adds support for views in the ActiveRecord::SchemaDumper class.

The following drivers are supported:

 MySQL
 PostgreSQL (Native and Pure Ruby)
 Oracle
 SQL Server
